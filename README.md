# bon -- bash on node

This is a bash script that helps run node.js or any scripts.

## Why

Node.js is great for cli scripts.  Sometimes bash is an easier fit.
This script is great for running commands generated by another script / cli.
It pretends to be the script it delegates to.  It also changes directory
before running the target script, assuming its identity and source location.

The former helps with commands that need being run in a tty shell / context,
for example if the target cli generated an ssh connection / command string.
The latter, for any extra files the script may need, such as configuration.


## Use

Bon is most convenient when paired with node.js cli scripts. It makes use of
the `$NODE_MODULES` env var to `cd` into the target module source directory.
Being packaged as a module itself helps with making it a dependency.
I use `commander` and thus assume `--help` is available, appending to it in
a way that matches [commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js)'s
formatting style.
